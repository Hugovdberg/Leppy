# 0. Installation

To use Python you can simply go to [python.org](https://python.org) and select the version suitable for your computer. This will install a vanilla copy of Python which you can use immediately. However, once you'll get into more advanced computations there's a fair chance you will want to use [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/whatisnumpy.html), which is a little harder to setup on Windows. Therefore, I recommend to install a precompiled distribution such as [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or [Enthough Canopy](https://store.enthought.com/downloads/). When downloading, make sure to select the Python 3.x version of the installer, so you can use the most recent features included in the language. 

Note, I do not have any affiliation with either company, nor do I say that there are no other good distributions. These two just seem to be the most popular distributions, which also provide versions for Windows, Linux and Mac computers.

**Warning:** these downloads are pretty sizable and depending on the speed of your internet connection and computer this step might actually take longer than 10 to 15 minutes.
