# Leppy

Leppy is a series of 10 to 15 minute, self contained, tutorials, teaching Python 3 from scratch. They were inspired by the Tea Break Tutorials by [ETC](https://www.etcconnect.com/Support/Tutorials/Eos-Family-v2-2-Tea-Break-Tutorials-Series.aspx?LangType=1033). The name comes from the Latin name for thread snakes, Leptotyphlopidae, a family which contains the smallest snakes in the world.
